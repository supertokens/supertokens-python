2. Go through the [SuperTokens Code of Conduct](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-python/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Where to ask Questions?

1. Check our [Github Issues](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-python/issues) to see if someone has already answered your question.
2. Join our community on [Discord](https://supertokens.io/discord) and feel free to ask us your questions

## Development Setup

You will need to setup the [supertokens-core](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core) in order to run the `supertokens-python` tests, you can setup `supertokens-core` by following this [guide](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-setup)  
**Note: If you are not contributing to the `supertokens-core` you can skip steps 1 & 4 under Project Setup of the `supertokens-core` contributing guide.**

### Prerequisites

-   Python (version 3.7 or above)
-   IDE: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)(recommended) OR [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) OR equivalent IDE

### Project Setup

1. Fork the [supertokens-python](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-python) repository.
2. Clone the forked repository in the parent directory of the previously setup `supertokens-root`.
   `supertokens-python` and `supertokens-root` should exist side by side within the same parent directory.
3. Create a virtual environment for the `supertokens-python` project and activate it.
4. Install the project dependencies
   `make dev-install`
5. Add git pre-commit hooks
   `make set-up-hooks`

## Modifying Code

- Open the `supertokens-python` project in your IDE and you can start modifying the code.
- Use `make check-lint` and `make format` to find lint/formatting errors before committing. (They will run anyways)

## Testing

1. Navigate to the [supertokens-root](https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-root) repository.
2. Start the testing environment  
   `./startTestEnv --wait`   
   and ensure the test environment is up and running.
3. Open a new terminal and navigate to the `supertokens-python` respositry.
4. Use `export SUPERTOKENS_PATH=path/to/supertokens-root` (**MANDATORY**)
4. To run all tests, while ensuring the test environment is running on a different terminal, use `make test`.
5. To run individual tests, use `pytest ./tests/path/to/test/file.py  -k test_function_name` OR use your IDE's in-built UI for running python tests. You may read [VSCode Python Testing](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing) and [PyCharm Testing](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/testing-your-first-python-application.html#debug-test) for more info.

## Pull Request

1. Before submitting a pull request make sure all tests have passed.
2. Reference the relevant issue or pull request and give a clear description of changes/features added when submitting a pull request.
3. Make sure the PR title follows [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

## Implementing RecipeInterfaces

- Make sure all CRUD operations are available via the `(a)?syncio` modules of that recipe.
- Make sure the corresponding `RecipeImplementation` takes type imports from the `interfaces.py` file of that recipe. This is so that if a user wants to copy / paste that code into their project, they can do so via the normal import statement.

## Implementing APIInterfaces
- Make sure the corresonding `APIImplementation` takes type imports from the `interfaces.py` file of that recipe. This is so that if a user wants to copy / paste that code into their project, they can do so via the normal import statement.

## Generating docs
This will generate the API docs in a folder called docs
```
make build-docs
```
